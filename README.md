# Ordina Assesment
This repository is only useful for the people from Ordina who I'll be having a conversation with next tuesday. After that this repo will probably be deleted.

## Notes
This filer contains only the source files required to run everything. To run the unit tests, you have to have JUnit5 installed and set up correctly.
